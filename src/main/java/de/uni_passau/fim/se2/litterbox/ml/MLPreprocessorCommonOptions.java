/**
 * Combines some options used for all machine learning preprocessing analyzers.
 *
 * @param outputPath            The path which the results should be written to.
 * @param includeStage          If the stage should be included like a regular sprite in the processing steps.
 * @param wholeProgram          If the whole program should be treated as a single entity instead of performing the
 *                              analysis per sprite.
 * @param includeDefaultSprites If output should be generated for sprites that have the default name, e.g. ‘Sprite1’.
 * @param abstractTokens        If literals and variable names should be replaced by generic placeholders, e.g.
 *                              {@code var}.
